Phundament is a Web Application Foundation built upon Docker, PHP and Yii Framework 2.0 and further tools, providing a consistent environment for rapidly developing web
applications - from development to deployment.


### Design goals

The goal of Phundament is to provide a rock-solid base for integrating the best tools and plugins for web-application development, 
while not creating a new framework or [another competing standard](http://xkcd.com/927/). 

Instead, existing tools are pre-configured in a clean and easy way and built on Docker images to ensure 100% compatibility across different platforms.

Compared to the standard Yii 2.0 application templates, Phundament introduces a configuration based on *environment variables*,
which gives you a maximum level of control over your application setup. It follows the [12factor specifications](http://12factor.net) on a very slim codebase.
